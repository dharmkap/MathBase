    Algebra is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.
  </p>
  <p>
    As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called <b><i>elementary algebra</i></b>; the more abstract parts are called <b><i>abstract algebra</i></b> or <b><i>modern algebra</i></b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.

          The quadratic formula expresses the solution of the degree two equation <b><i>ax^<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0</i></b> in terms of its coefficients <b><i>a,b,c</i></b>, where <b><i>a</i></b> is not zero.

    Algebra gives methods for solving equations and expressing formulas that are much easier (for those who know how to use them) than the older method of writing everything out in words.
